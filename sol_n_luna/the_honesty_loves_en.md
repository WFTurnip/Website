# The Honesty Loves

Sol and Luna, offspring of Omnnan, the God of Light, and Axksia, the
Goddess of Ardor, shared an affection as profound as it was enigmatic,
their bond resembling that of twins. Yet, their hearts wrestled with an
unspoken sentiment, a conflict that, on occasion, left them in visible
turmoil.

As time wove its tapestry of maturation, their awareness of one another
deepened. Sol\'s form grew robust and commanding, while Luna\'s figure
acquired a grace so delicate it seemed to dance with the very air. These
transformations, though innocent in essence, stirred within them a
bashful magnetism, manifesting as blushes that stained their cheeks
scarlet.

One day, with a voice tinged with mischief, Luna addressed her brother.
"Pray, my dear brother," she began, "do you gaze upon me with thoughts
most unbecoming?" Sol, startled, retorted, "Nay, sister! Such notions
are far from me." Yet, his faltering tone betrayed him. Luna, emboldened
by his discomposure, stepped nearer, saying, "Then, if my visage pleases
you so, would it not be amiss to bestow upon me some token of fondness?"
Her words, though spoken lightly, rendered Sol silent, his heart a
tempest of emotion.

Luna, ever perceptive, pressed on, her voice a blend of jest and
sincerity. "Does your heart quicken, my brother? Tell me truly, what
place do I hold within it?" Sol, unable to contain his sentiment,
enveloped her in an embrace, murmuring, "You are my cherished sister,
Luna. It is a love as pure as the heavens themselves." Tears welled in
her eyes as she whispered, "Brother... forgive my folly. I was adrift in
the sea of my own confusion."

In the solitude of his chamber that evening, Sol\'s gaze fell upon a
notebook belonging to Luna. Its pages, inked with words that mirrored
their shared lives, unfolded a tale of two souls ensnared by profound
yet perplexing affection. As he read on, the narrative\'s fervor began
to resonate with him, drawing uncanny parallels to their own bond.
Closing the book with a tremulous sigh, he pondered, "What does Luna
seek within my heart?"

Later, upon discovering the phrase "I adore my sibling..." penned in the
margins, Sol understood her turmoil. The story was not mere fancy; it
was Luna's means to untangle the vines of her emotions. Moved, he wrote
a simple note---"Me too, my beloved sibling"---and slipped it between
the pages.

The following morn, Luna stumbled upon his missive. Her heart swelled
with a clarity newfound. That evening, as they conversed under the
gentle glow of their shared chamber, she softly queried, "Brother, did
you chance upon my writings?" Though Sol admitted his curiosity with a
sheepish smile, Luna responded not with anger but with a radiant
tear-filled gaze. "Thank you, my brother," she said, her voice trembling
yet joyous. "I love you." To this, Sol replied with unwavering
sincerity, "And I, you."
