# The Dishonesty Loves

Several days had passed since the day Sol and Luna cast away their inner turmoil and finally confessed their love for each other. A new, gentle silence flowed between them—like a soft breeze, comforting in its presence. Yet somehow, that breeze felt a bit too gentle for them both, stirring a yearning for a stronger wind they dared not call upon.

Suddenly, a storm of emotion blew through them. It led them once again into a wilderness of conflict. As their eyes met, they both hesitated, then smiled softly and tried to walk away as if nothing had happened. But in the next instant, the wind shifted—becoming a tailwind neither of them truly wanted.

Sol pulled Luna close and whispered in her ear,
> “How passionate am I in your version of the story?”
Her ears flushed red as she murmured in a small voice,
> “More…”
He replied,
> “More, huh?”
gently pressing his forehead to hers, then added,
> “Then maybe I’ll be a bit bolder.”
With that, he touched her cheek and kissed her.
Luna, momentarily at a loss for words, smiled softly and said,
> “You’re gentle.”
Her smile held a fleeting sorrow, and at the same time, a silent longing for something more intense. Moved by that expression, Sol held her even tighter.

Though their love in the story burned with passion, living it out felt like betraying their own hearts. Every touch to the cheek, every press of the forehead, made Luna acutely aware that this moment of passion would soon pass. Tears welled up in her eyes.
> “I’m lying to you, big brother,”
she whispered.
When he asked why, she said through her tears,
> “I feel like I’m forcing the version of you from the story onto the real you.”

He replied,
> “That’s not true. I’m happy you think of me that way, Luna.”
Then, as he gently held her, he added,
> “I’ve always wondered what kind of ideal you had of me, too.”
At those words, Luna burst into sobs, her body trembling, unable to speak through the cries. All he could do was hold her close.

In that moment, something broke inside Sol.
> “Luna,”
he called her name, then held her with all the strength he had.
> “I… I—”
he stammered through tears, his embrace firm and desperate.
> “I mustn’t let go of this person.”
His eyes burned with conviction, but his heart was too fragile to carry it out. Though he feared saying,
> “I can't be your ideal,”
he was even more afraid that such words would become a wedge that forever pierced her heart and twisted the future ahead.

Luna, still teary-eyed, looked at Sol’s trembling back and asked softly,
> “Big brother?”
Her innocent gaze met his downcast face, where tears brimmed but never fell. His breath trembled, his throat unable to form any words. All he could do was fight not to cry, and to keep her from seeing the turmoil in his heart.
> “You don’t have to be strong. You’re my big brother, and that’s enough.”
She smiled gently and kissed his cheek.
Tears that had welled up in Sol’s eyes now fell, one by one. He sniffled and asked in a broken voice,
> “It’s okay not to be strong?”
Her soft embrace wrapped around him—it was a touch filled with maternal warmth.
Her words and actions were forgiveness itself.
In that moment, the brother who had always tried to be strong for her was saved by his little sister’s compassion.

The ideals each of them held—of how the other should be—had bound them in a thorny tangle of suffering. But by confronting and revealing their real selves, they were able to break free.
Their tears did not dry up, but rather continued to flow openly, freeing them both.
And once again, by exchanging their love, they came to understand each other’s hearts even more deeply.
